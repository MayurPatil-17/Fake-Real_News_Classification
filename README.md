## 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP

This project focuses on detecting fake and real news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. By analyzing the textual content of news headlines or full articles, the model classifies them as either fake or real.

**🔍 Project Highlights**

*Data Preprocessing:* Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, CountVectorizer).

*Modeling:* Implemented and evaluated various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, XGBOOST and Random Forests.

*Evaluation:* Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance analysis.

*Visualization:* Included EDA plots and word clouds for better understanding of the dataset.

**📁 Dataset**

The dataset used is a labeled collection of fake and real news articles, commonly sourced from Kaggle.

**📊 Results**
Achieved an accuracy of 99.71% with the best-performing model.
